                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to only engage with one enemy at one time, peeking multiple enemies significantly reduces your chances of survival and getting a kill.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes accidentally shooting before you character is completely still this results in your first few bullets being inaccurate, often getting you killed.</li>
                    <li>Use your minimap when you teammates are not communicating effectively this is a hard skill to develop but the sooner you develop it the more you can benefit from it.</li>
                    <li>Low sens getting you in trouble a few times when an enemy was outside of your comfortable range although fortuantely it didn't effect you to badly.</li>
                    <li>When picking positions, some of the deciding factors should be: Good cover? Headshot angle? Can I fall back? at times during this match your positioning wasn't ideal exposing yourself to multiple opponents at once without good cover.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour Solid pathing up catwalk but your pathing and direction looking wasn’t right and this nearly got you punished and when you managed to take the engagement unfortunately you peeked quite deep allowing a second enemy to see you. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, solid attempt at up catwalk and killing the enemy's CT, unfortunately, the glock is the weakest weapon on T side and it would have required you to body shot him 8 times in order to kill him. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement into lowers and good job clearing your corners, nice rotation through lowers but your movement onto the boxes and around it nearly got you killed a few times and then you managed to secure a kill on an unaware CT in CT and you saw him cross but still cleared other angles which was unnecessary, you were caught off-guard by the enemy pushing long which was a 90-degree flick but due to your low sens this caused you not to be able to look at him in time. L</li>
                    <li>SG553, solid attempt at peeking B but your peek was executed wrong unfortunately and this got you especially while moving backwards. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice peek out middle although you are shooting before you are completely still and your crosshair is lined up with the head this forced you to go for the spam, still good job getting the trade kill unfortunately you got immediately traded. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good call on the enemy car and solid bomb plant although you call “CT?” wasn’t right I recommend zooming out your minimap so you can see the entire map this has multiple benefits. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, Good idea to get into pit so you can have the headshot angle although your awping on the enemy peeking site didn’t work out ideally. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid B take with no action, weird positioning car afterplant and good covering fire to prevent the enemies in tunnels from peeking. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement up catwalk and good job being weary of the smoke and nice adjustment to secure the trade kill although the low sens made it sketchy, peeking site with an AK against an awp is not ideal as the enemy gets the headshot angle and the distance advantage for their weapon. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, Good job taking long controls and then holding the flank unfortunately your position left you open to being baited which is exactly what happened and this led to you not having any cover and getting killed. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, good attempt at the early trade and eventually peeking and killing the enemy pit although on your fallback to Long house you ended up getting peeked by an awper and didn’t even react. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, nice movement out long and good job getting to blue container but your peek onto car wasn't executed correctly and you ended up trying to spray through the car while crouch walking, which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job going agro through middle and solid peek on the enemy middle securing the second entry and good job killing the enemy on B who was sneaking up on you, and then a very nice third peek into CT securing a third. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at peeking out long but it was slightly unfocused and slow this allowed the enemy peeking to have the advantage in this fight and get the early kill on you. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, solid movement up catwalk although your exact pathing could have been slightly better as you exposed yourself to the enemies CT, good molly catwalk and nice kill also good reactions to hide and for the enemy to push you as well as wasting time so even if he did the bomb would have exploded. W</li>
                    <li>CT Pistol buy, positioning on B was bad as you had no cover at all and you were completely vulnerable to the basic B flashes, which is what got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, solid trade on the enemy middle although your positioning could have been slightly closer to cover to give you time to regain the positional advantage and peek out again with confidence. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice headshot on the galiel bought enemy long and this is why upgrading your headarmour is important! as getting killed by a full save CT while full bought is not nice, good positioning by blue container securing a second kill unfortunately you get immediately traded. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really good use of the long door off-angle allowing you to get the kill on the first enemy coming out although your spray whiff nearly caused you to lose it, I would have recommended calling for a save immediately as the bomb had been down for 10 seconds by the time you decided to go for the retake and when you were in tunnels it had already been down for 25 seconds so the retake was almost impossible and you could have brought those guns into the next round. L</li>
                    <li>Fiveseven buy, a little slow on the lowers push which got you caught in middle against 2 full bought T’s there was nothing you could do. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid peek into middle although unfortunately it was against 1-way and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice usage of the off-angle long again although this can be improved slightly by holding further to the left, solid spray to secure the first enemy coming out long, reloading very close to the angle that is dangerous wasn’t a god idea, and running around unfocused while showing your back to the dangerous angle got you killed always look at the most dangerous angle to you at all times. W</li>
                    <li>p90 buy, good patience sitting in the cross smoke but I would have recommended instead of just rushing through looking for the gap in the smoke and playing around that instead and that would have given you a significantly more favourable gun fight and you could have potentially fallen back afterwards, but still a solid kill pushing through. W</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, the p90 is strong but be wary of being overly reliant on it as its effectiveness falls off dramatically as you face stronger opponents, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, interesting choice to trade the AK for an M4, as the AK is the superior weapon, nice reaction to the weird out B smoke by jumping ontop of box to look over it, your reposition as the enemies entered onto the B site was bad as you had no cover also you ran extremely low on bullets but still had that gun out this nearly got you killed I would have recommended immediately pulling out your pistol or reloading, fortunately the enemy gave you time to miss the 1 shot in your m4 and pull out your pistol. W</li>
                    <li>Buy, unfortunate timing on the peek up to A from CT as the enemy had flanked you from B doors. L</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, unfortunate engagement against the enemy peeking you door. L</li>
                    <li>MP7 buy, agro peek into middle up to catwalk wasn’t a great idea as the enemy was significantly outside of your optimal range and this got you heavily tagged and then again you peeked through the smoke but you had very very little bullets in your smg which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, good kill on the enemy using a 1-way smoke long, a lot of forward and backwards strafing which is quite dangerous as the vast majority of people are not comfortable with this kind of movement, good job securing a second kill on the enemy peeking long and upgrading to an SG 553, good patience not to get overly greedy and instead wait inside long house. W</li>
                    <li>SG553 buy, bad nade landing shallow inside tunnels that would only affect enemies rushing B, good comms on the enemies crossing CT that you spotted from long car, good job securing the bomb but pulling out utility while peeking an unknown angle was a great idea</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Pretty happy and I got my drink.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I was just kind of following my teammates and I hated it and there are particular angles I like, like A long, also the teammates were force buying every single round.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>It seems like it was more on the enemy than not.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Flicks sometimes landed on the enemy and my positions were particularly uncomfortable I felt like they were forced apon me, My sprays did not feel that bad.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Long and catwalk if felt good but on B site it felt off.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I feel like I missed a lot of jumps but I did hit some hops to speed up my movement and there were a few walls I banged into.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>Horrible and I didn’t buy utility.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>timely no to sure, but most of the information was accurate.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Fuck my teammates and hold the position I want. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Honestly, 2 of them seems really chilled</li>

                    <li>AK buy, sick shot onto the enemy short while you were blind, slightly dangerous positioning in the after-plant. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice kill on the enemy lowers although the bad peek, I recommend standing on the ground and then peeking into the angle, walking into lowers exposing yourself slightly and then holding for the peek catwalk and getting pushed lowers. L</li>

                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, holding B from middle which is a very nice long range angle, good communication calling the enemies are going agro catwalk, really nice shots on the enemy on site and fantastic flick onto the enemy goose and a solid third to kill another on site, unfortunately the last enemy killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice early rotate to A from B after realizing they took long and short control, although positioning during the full save wasn’t ideal, as you sat in CT fighting the cross, you want to close the distance between you and the enemy and force a close range fight, or sit at an unexpected angle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice bursting into catwalk as the enemy rushed, solid rotate through middle but didn’t clear catwalk properly which caught you slightly off-guard, and bad spray on the enemy catwalk leads to you dying. L</li>
                    <li>SWAG-7, nice positioning on box outside B tunnels playing that close range  angle, good aggression into tunnels and really nice kill on the enemy lowers, good job switching to the galiel, and nice flank through their spawn, but your spray control whiffed causing you to miss your shots. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning Platform B into tunnels, good job checking the dangerous angle middle while crossing, and good reaction and dodge to the flash middle and solid kill. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, small movement mistake on the cross, bad LOS utility just standing out in the open on B when dropping the molly tunnels, solid rotation but a little bit slow on the retake, causing the retake to be impossible due to the bomb, really nice kill on the enemy goose, unfortunately, couldn’t secure the second. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice long take although running across with the same peek you did with a molly is a bad idea as it leaves a lot of room open for you to get shot at while crossing, unfortunate peek out B window and not clearing under window which got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice peek long and good job securing 1 kill but your decision to crouch into this fight is what got you killed as the enemies could easily see what your intentions were in this engagement and that you were committed to the fight. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice long hold and rotate to A site and holding short good awareness, solid rotation to B and good retake kill on the enemy on platform. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really nice utility long with the Molly into a grenade and then a smoke to follow up but a small problem was you reloading out in the open (behind your smoke) but still technically in the open, good off-angle onto long house and solid kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid long take, good retake and solid kill on the agro enemy window, good play to go into the smoke as it was fading which gave you the advantage. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, bad molly long due to low sens 180s are incredibly difficult and this  caused you to whiff, also you continued crossing without ducking behind cover which got you punished for 50hp, whiffed spray on the enemy who came out long late. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you didn’t buy body armour, and were slow to long which caused you to have to fall back, to CT, while in CT if your 2 teammates are up short you should push through CT instead of rotating late up short to get the kill. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice molly long, although you did swing wide immediately again, and nice use of the off-angle long to secure a kill on long. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice use of the pit headshot angle, changing things up a bit, good job holding the danger angle while rotating around, good distraction on the last enemy out B although your spray messed up a bit causing your bullets to rise significantly above the enemy's head. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, nice peek onto catwalk but your crosshair placement is low causing you to body shot the enemy 4 times, going for that headshot is crucial on pistol rounds. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, middle rush, nice job killon the scout window. L</li>
                    <li>SG553, solid peek-out long, good bursting through the car long to get the kill, nice kill on the enemy peeking from site and good positioning in Pit. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, nice smoke long, solid prefire on the enemy long and good adjustment to get the kill, good peek into CT and solid kill, unfortunately, killed by the third. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice peek into middle, nice movement up short and good kill on the enemy long. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice b push although not recommended with awp, you landed a nice shot onto the enemy door, I recommend as the awper you focus tunnels which you did in the beginning which allows you to get a kill but your focus kept switching to window, which got you killed by the second enemy. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice shot through middle smoke getting a kill on the enemy in the corner short. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, good job instantly trading your teammate coming out long, although as you were running up long you pulled out your utility in the middle of the open which nearly got you punished, unfortunately after you crossed to site they pushed through the cross smoke. L</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, leaving long completely open unfortunately this gets you punished by a push. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, solid rotation to a mid to B after going through tunnels didn’t really work, positioning wasn’t ideal as you were exposed to multiple angles, good solid reaction and good kill on the enemy window. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, good movement up long and solid positioning car. W</li>
