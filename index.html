                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to only engage with one enemy at one time, peeking multiple enemies significantly reduces your chances of survival and getting a kill.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes accidentally shooting before you character is completely still this results in your first few bullets being inaccurate, often getting you killed.</li>
                    <li>Use your minimap when you teammates are not communicating effectively this is a hard skill to develop but the sooner you develop it the more you can benefit from it.</li>
                    <li>Low sens getting you in trouble a few times when an enemy was outside of your comfortable range although fortuantely it didn't effect you to badly.</li>
                    <li>When picking positions, some of the deciding factors should be: Good cover? Headshot angle? Can I fall back? at times during this match your positioning wasn't ideal exposing yourself to multiple opponents at once without good cover.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour Solid pathing up catwalk but your pathing and direction looking wasn’t right and this nearly got you punished and when you managed to take the engagement unfortunately you peeked quite deep allowing a second enemy to see you. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, solid attempt at up catwalk and killing the enemy's CT, unfortunately, the glock is the weakest weapon on T side and it would have required you to body shot him 8 times in order to kill him. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement into lowers and good job clearing your corners, nice rotation through lowers but your movement onto the boxes and around it nearly got you killed a few times and then you managed to secure a kill on an unaware CT in CT and you saw him cross but still cleared other angles which was unnecessary, you were caught off-guard by the enemy pushing long which was a 90-degree flick but due to your low sens this caused you not to be able to look at him in time. L</li>
                    <li>SG553, solid attempt at peeking B but your peek was executed wrong unfortunately and this got you especially while moving backwards. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice peek out middle although you are shooting before you are completely still and your crosshair is lined up with the head this forced you to go for the spam, still good job getting the trade kill unfortunately you got immediately traded. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good call on the enemy car and solid bomb plant although you call “CT?” wasn’t right I recommend zooming out your minimap so you can see the entire map this has multiple benefits. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, Good idea to get into pit so you can have the headshot angle although your awping on the enemy peeking site didn’t work out ideally. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid B take with no action, weird positioning car afterplant and good covering fire to prevent the enemies in tunnels from peeking. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement up catwalk and good job being weary of the smoke and nice adjustment to secure the trade kill although the low sens made it sketchy, peeking site with an AK against an awp is not ideal as the enemy gets the headshot angle and the distance advantage for their weapon. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, Good job taking long controls and then holding the flank unfortunately your position left you open to being baited which is exactly what happened and this led to you not having any cover and getting killed. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, good attempt at the early trade and eventually peeking and killing the enemy pit although on your fallback to Long house you ended up getting peeked by an awper and didn’t even react. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, nice movement out long and good job getting to blue container but your peek onto car wasn't executed correctly and you ended up trying to spray through the car while crouch walking, which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job going agro through middle and solid peek on the enemy middle securing the second entry and good job killing the enemy on B who was sneaking up on you, and then a very nice third peek into CT securing a third. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at peeking out long but it was slightly unfocused and slow this allowed the enemy peeking to have the advantage in this fight and get the early kill on you. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, solid movement up catwalk although your exact pathing could have been slightly better as you exposed yourself to the enemies CT, good molly catwalk and nice kill also good reactions to hide and for the enemy to push you as well as wasting time so even if he did the bomb would have exploded. W</li>
                    <li>CT Pistol buy, positioning on B was bad as you had no cover at all and you were completely vulnerable to the basic B flashes, which is what got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, solid trade on the enemy middle although your positioning could have been slightly closer to cover to give you time to regain the positional advantage and peek out again with confidence. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice headshot on the galiel bought enemy long and this is why upgrading your headarmour is important! as getting killed by a full save CT while full bought is not nice, good positioning by blue container securing a second kill unfortunately you get immediately traded. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really good use of the long door off-angle allowing you to get the kill on the first enemy coming out although your spray whiff nearly caused you to lose it, I would have recommended calling for a save immediately as the bomb had been down for 10 seconds by the time you decided to go for the retake and when you were in tunnels it had already been down for 25 seconds so the retake was almost impossible and you could have brought those guns into the next round. L</li>
                    <li>Fiveseven buy, a little slow on the lowers push which got you caught in middle against 2 full bought T’s there was nothing you could do. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid peek into middle although unfortunately it was against 1-way and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice usage of the off-angle long again although this can be improved slightly by holding further to the left, solid spray to secure the first enemy coming out long, reloading very close to the angle that is dangerous wasn’t a god idea, and running around unfocused while showing your back to the dangerous angle got you killed always look at the most dangerous angle to you at all times. W</li>
                    <li>p90 buy, good patience sitting in the cross smoke but I would have recommended instead of just rushing through looking for the gap in the smoke and playing around that instead and that would have given you a significantly more favourable gun fight and you could have potentially fallen back afterwards, but still a solid kill pushing through. W</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, the p90 is strong but be wary of being overly reliant on it as its effectiveness falls off dramatically as you face stronger opponents, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, interesting choice to trade the AK for an M4, as the AK is the superior weapon, nice reaction to the weird out B smoke by jumping ontop of box to look over it, your reposition as the enemies entered onto the B site was bad as you had no cover also you ran extremely low on bullets but still had that gun out this nearly got you killed I would have recommended immediately pulling out your pistol or reloading, fortunately the enemy gave you time to miss the 1 shot in your m4 and pull out your pistol. W</li>
                    <li>Buy, unfortunate timing on the peek up to A from CT as the enemy had flanked you from B doors. L</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, unfortunate engagement against the enemy peeking you door. L</li>
                    <li>MP7 buy, agro peek into middle up to catwalk wasn’t a great idea as the enemy was significantly outside of your optimal range and this got you heavily tagged and then again you peeked through the smoke but you had very very little bullets in your smg which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, good kill on the enemy using a 1-way smoke long, a lot of forward and backwards strafing which is quite dangerous as the vast majority of people are not comfortable with this kind of movement, good job securing a second kill on the enemy peeking long and upgrading to an SG 553, good patience not to get overly greedy and instead wait inside long house. W</li>
                    <li>SG553 buy, bad nade landing shallow inside tunnels that would only affect enemies rushing B, good comms on the enemies crossing CT that you spotted from long car, good job securing the bomb but pulling out utility while peeking an unknown angle was a great idea</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Pretty happy and I got my drink.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I was just kind of following my teammates and I hated it and there are particular angles I like, like A long, also the teammates were force buying every single round.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>It seems like it was more on the enemy than not.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Flicks sometimes landed on the enemy and my positions were particularly uncomfortable I felt like they were forced apon me, My sprays did not feel that bad.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Long and catwalk if felt good but on B site it felt off.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I feel like I missed a lot of jumps but I did hit some hops to speed up my movement and there were a few walls I banged into.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>Horrible and I didn’t buy utility.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>timely no to sure, but most of the information was accurate.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Fuck my teammates and hold the position I want. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Honestly, 2 of them seems really chilled</li>

                    <li>AK buy, sick shot onto the enemy short while you were blind, slightly dangerous positioning in the after-plant. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice kill on the enemy lowers although the bad peek, I recommend standing on the ground and then peeking into the angle, walking into lowers exposing yourself slightly and then holding for the peek catwalk and getting pushed lowers. L</li>
                    <li>Sg553 buy, solid double kill on the enemies long. L</li>

                    <li>Awp buy, good job getting the kill on the enemy pushing long, although your crosshair placement was quite high, nice double kill on the enemies on site. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, peeked CT while reloading which unfortunately got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, planting for a positon you no longer had control over while planting for short which there was an enemy there, good Shot. W</li>

                    <li>CT Pistol Armour, solid kill on one once you've noticed you are low I recommend disengaging to a safe position, unfortunately focusing on too many angles at once. W</li>
                    <li>Mp7 buy, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Mp7 buy, solid kill on the enemy in tunnels, going for the reload positon exposed in tunnels with 12 bullets. W</li>

            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>During full saves, I recommend picking angles that are super close range which makes it so getting a headshot with your pistol does max damage as well as making the headshot easier to get, I also recommend often overlooked positions as this would sometimes allow you to get overlooked.</li>
                    <li>LOS utility while standing in the open is dangerous and can often get you killed.</li>
                    <li>Don't cross long in the same peek you throw the long molly as this leaves you open for about 2 seconds after dropping the utility in which you can get punished by enemies rushing.</li>
                    <li>When you crouch and there are multiple enemies on your screen is guarantees your death as it makes movement extremely slow and makes the job for the enemies of lining up a headshot much easier as well as telling them your intensions.</li>
                    <li>Get more comfortable making big swipes as currently your large swipes are still a bit inaccurate and you can't consistently hit a 90 degree or a 180 flick.</li>

                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, holding B from middle which is a very nice long range angle, good communication calling the enemies are going agro catwalk, really nice shots on the enemy on site and fantastic flick onto the enemy goose and a solid third to kill another on site, unfortunately the last enemy killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice early rotate to A from B after realizing they took long and short control, although positioning during the full save wasn’t ideal, as you sat in CT fighting the cross, you want to close the distance between you and the enemy and force a close range fight, or sit at an unexpected angle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice bursting into catwalk as the enemy rushed, solid rotate through middle but didn’t clear catwalk properly which caught you slightly off-guard, and bad spray on the enemy catwalk leads to you dying. L</li>
                    <li>SWAG-7, nice positioning on box outside B tunnels playing that close range  angle, good aggression into tunnels and really nice kill on the enemy lowers, good job switching to the galiel, and nice flank through their spawn, but your spray control whiffed causing you to miss your shots. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning Platform B into tunnels, good job checking the dangerous angle middle while crossing, and good reaction and dodge to the flash middle and solid kill. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, small movement mistake on the cross, bad LOS utility just standing out in the open on B when dropping the molly tunnels, solid rotation but a little bit slow on the retake, causing the retake to be impossible due to the bomb, really nice kill on the enemy goose, unfortunately, couldn’t secure the second. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice long take although running across with the same peek you did with a molly is a bad idea as it leaves a lot of room open for you to get shot at while crossing, unfortunate peek out B window and not clearing under window which got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice peek long and good job securing 1 kill but your decision to crouch into this fight is what got you killed as the enemies could easily see what your intentions were in this engagement and that you were committed to the fight. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice long hold and rotate to A site and holding short good awareness, solid rotation to B and good retake kill on the enemy on platform. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really nice utility long with the Molly into a grenade and then a smoke to follow up but a small problem was you reloading out in the open (behind your smoke) but still technically in the open, good off-angle onto long house and solid kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid long take, good retake and solid kill on the agro enemy window, good play to go into the smoke as it was fading which gave you the advantage. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, bad molly long due to low sens 180s are incredibly difficult and this  caused you to whiff, also you continued crossing without ducking behind cover which got you punished for 50hp, whiffed spray on the enemy who came out long late. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you didn’t buy body armour, and were slow to long which caused you to have to fall back, to CT, while in CT if your 2 teammates are up short you should push through CT instead of rotating late up short to get the kill. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice molly long, although you did swing wide immediately again, and nice use of the off-angle long to secure a kill on long. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice use of the pit headshot angle, changing things up a bit, good job holding the danger angle while rotating around, good distraction on the last enemy out B although your spray messed up a bit causing your bullets to rise significantly above the enemy's head. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, nice peek onto catwalk but your crosshair placement is low causing you to body shot the enemy 4 times, going for that headshot is crucial on pistol rounds. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, middle rush, nice job killon the scout window. L</li>
                    <li>SG553, solid peek-out long, good bursting through the car long to get the kill, nice kill on the enemy peeking from site and good positioning in Pit. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, nice smoke long, solid prefire on the enemy long and good adjustment to get the kill, good peek into CT and solid kill, unfortunately, killed by the third. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice peek into middle, nice movement up short and good kill on the enemy long. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice b push although not recommended with awp, you landed a nice shot onto the enemy door, I recommend as the awper you focus tunnels which you did in the beginning which allows you to get a kill but your focus kept switching to window, which got you killed by the second enemy. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice shot through middle smoke getting a kill on the enemy in the corner short. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, good job instantly trading your teammate coming out long, although as you were running up long you pulled out your utility in the middle of the open which nearly got you punished, unfortunately after you crossed to site they pushed through the cross smoke. L</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, leaving long completely open unfortunately this gets you punished by a push. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, solid rotation to a mid to B after going through tunnels didn’t really work, positioning wasn’t ideal as you were exposed to multiple angles, good solid reaction and good kill on the enemy window. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, good movement up long and solid positioning car. W</li>

                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol rounds are crucial to winning and I always recommend at least buying body armour on these rounds.</li>
                    <li>LOS utility, exposing yourself to angles if the enemy gets a decent timing they could peek you while you have utility pulled.</li>
                    <li>Reloading while vulnerable to a push or peek from an enemy happened often this game.</li>
                    <li>Try to follow through with your engagements a bit more as if the first part of your spray doesn't feel right you will often stop shooting to reset and this got you killed a couple times.</li>
                    <li>Full buys are the most important rounds of the games, and as such I want you to always buy full utility on these rounds even if that brings your bank to $0 because every piece of utility can incrementally increase your chances of winning the round. “It's better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.” ― George Ellis</li>
                    <li>Last round of the half always use every dollar you can by buying full utility and a secondary as saving money is a waste.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Overpass</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol, no armour which was an interesting choice I usually always recommend buying at least body armour on pistol rounds as they are very important rounds to win, a good attempt at moving up lane to attack A site from a different position but unfortunately the enemy was close lane. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice positioning top first oranges unfortunately you were not completely focused on the fight top banana which allowed the first enemy up to catch you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid grenade but standing with a molly pulled out towards top banana was dangerous and you ended up throwing some LOS utility top banana, solid positioning family and good timing on the peek catching one completely off-guard but you chose to reload with 12 bullets which is above the recommended minimum of 11 bullets so you could have tried for one more before reloading, unfortunately, you decided to reload and this allowed the enemy to catch you off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid utility towards banana, good peeking on coffins, solid rotation towards A although not committing to the initial fight against the enemy on site caused you to lose this engagement. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, peeking banana a bit halfheartedly, almost getting you killed, nice positioning top second oranges really solid damage. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a little bit of money left $350 during gun rounds you want to use every dollar on giving you the best chance of winning this round, because the rifle rounds are the rounds that matter, solid rotation towards A from being smoked B and good kill on the enemy from library, unfortunate rotation around A site to lane and looking towards middle and boiler when there is a high probably there is no-one there. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, good job backing up your teammate's banana and helping get a kill, even if your teammate's coffins played completely passive and you let the enemies run onto site if he fought them while they were on site this would have given you a much better fight, good job securing a second. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid utility towards banana, unfortunate peek into brackets which was quite unfocused and not ready for the engagement. L</li>
                    <li>Swag-7, an interesting weapon choice when full money, really solid kill on the enemy top banana and nice follow-up kill on the enemy banana, unfortunately, while going for the third the enemy used the fading smoke as cover. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, switching to the A site, solid utility with the smoke apps and molly lane, good job securing the one kill on the enemy lane although it was a little bit sketchy, unfortunately after this engagement, you were low on ammo and died while reloading. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, lining up LOS utility from graveyard into apps isn’t a great play, missed the molly, good rotation to B and good kill on the enemy crossing the bad CT smoke, although after this engagement you decided to reload while running around in church and then due to the reloading sound the enemy felt compelled to push through the smoke and catch you while reloading. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid nade towards banana, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, still leaving extra utility with 2.5K in the bank even if the flash and smoke gives you a 2% better chance of winning the round, I recommend buying it, its better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it, especially during gun rounds, I really like this position on balcony, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again only having a grenade while having 5.8K in the bank, while rotating through arches I always recommend if there is a chance they pushed through you clear your corners, unfortunately, the enemy was in a solid library angle. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice kill on the enemy middle but again, last round of the half and you didn’t buy a secondary to complement your awp or utility with an extra 2.1K in that bank, solid switching weapons and you caught him while he was jumping but you didn’t trust your spray and this allowed the enemy to land and then get the shots on you. L</li>
                    <li>Pistol armour, interesting angle Mexico crouching while peeking top middle, hitting an enemy arches with a burst from the glock absolutely destroying him, good job planting the bomb, again committing with the burst probably wasn’t ideal but you managed to secure a second using it. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job rotating over to app and taking the safe route as you were carrying the bomb, unfortunately, the enemy pit was sitting at a good angle. L</li>
                    <li>armour? using default weapon, this is quite unfortunate you asked your teammate for a drop, as you pushed up banana you got tagged from banana and once that target was dealt with you peeked banana like you assumed there was no-one there which unfortunately there was and this got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>SG553, solid kill and peeking towards top banana, nice peek on the enemy arches and good second kill. W</li>
                    <li>SG553, interesting utility banana, bad LOS utility peeking an angle with utility out which could have easily gotten you immediately killed, good job after peeking the enemies with a grenade out switching to your weapon and securing 2 kills. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid positioning towards ramp, I would recommend following Cadians rule, which is where if a player is extremely low hp you give the awp to them, really nice peek on the enemy coffins, unfortunately, it was slightly off, the enemies closed in on you. L</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>very sleepy, nothing else.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>Honestly, I played the two positions I liked.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>It was definitely sometimes, my aim was definitely on the low side, but I feel like I did have my flicks here and there but I do believe my reactions were quite slow due to me being tired.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Honestly, if I feel like my spray was up to date, I feel like my flicks were actually not horrible. </li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Counter-strafing felt meh not the best and my peeks didn’t feel horrible. on A I wasn’t too focused on how I was peeking.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I definitely feel like I picked the right paths and there were a couple times I did it too early and a couple times where I performed it just right, I am pretty bad at retaking A, I don’t remember if I made noise where I didn’t want to.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>There were a couple of times when I questioned my teammates, I don’t usually do much utility but I feel like B felt quite normal and I stayed in my comfort zone and I usually only use the basic utility towards banana, I think I could have smoke better to hold them off.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>There were a couple where I was off but most of them were on point.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I feel like I really should have practised a B → A rotation more.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Team was awesome, and I added 2.</li>
